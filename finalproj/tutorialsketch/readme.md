For my final project, I decided to use the p5.sound library.  I plan on making an acapella jam session.  By clicking on each instrument graphic, a new sound will loop and the sounds together will make cool harmonies.  I will do this by uploading mp3s of the sounds into assets.  Then, I will create several play and pause buttons using buttonArray and buttonObject.  I will create all of the instrument images on photoshop.  I will make if statements that make it so that if one clicks on the play button, not only will the sound play, but it will loop.  I will do this by using the soundfile.loop(); command.  In my sketch, I showed how I would program one of the instruments with the sound, play and pause and looping mechanisms.
